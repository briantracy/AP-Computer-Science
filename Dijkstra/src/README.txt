Sample Output:

Node A | Distance 0  | Last Visited A | The shortest path between [Node A] and [The Starting Node (A)] is [A].
Node B | Distance 3  | Last Visited A | The shortest path between [Node B] and [The Starting Node (A)] is [B-A].
Node C | Distance 7  | Last Visited B | The shortest path between [Node C] and [The Starting Node (A)] is [C-B-A].
Node D | Distance 9  | Last Visited C | The shortest path between [Node D] and [The Starting Node (A)] is [D-C-B-A].
