THE PALY SPORTS APP

The Paly sports app is the interface between Paly students and their sports teams. With this app, anybody has access to the dates and times of all Paly sport events. 

Created for the iOS platform, our app offers an easy and quick way to check out the local sports scene.


ABOUT THE VIDEO

The video we made for our app demonstrates an average use case for the app and showcases the positive outcome of using the app.

The video shows how using the Paly sports app can connect a person to Paly sports. In the video, Matt checks the app and can see that there are no paly games going on. This means that he can practice with his team without having to worry about being kicked off of the field. If Matt had not double checked with the app, his practice could have been scheduled during a game on the same field. Our app prevents wasting time going to a Paly field just to find out that someone is already playing on it.

The Paly sports app also enables students to find out when their friends may be playing so they can watch their games.
