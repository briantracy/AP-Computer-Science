Abstract Data Types = set of methods + semantics of methods. Non specific implementation. High Level

Client vs Provider

A stack is a collection like arrays, linked lists.

Last In First Out (LIFO) acheived through push and pop
In the Java implementation of a stack, these methods return the opaque type Object. It is up to the programmer to cast accordingly.

Stacks can be empty.

Since (Java) stacks can only deal with objects, any primitives must be wrapped / boxed before pushing to the stack.
Wrappers can be unboxed back to their respective primitive types.

Hex and Octal.

Infix operations go between operands, postfix go after, and prefix go before.

Parsing something breaks it into tokens. Delimiters are used during tokenization
StringTokenizer can take a delimiter and parse a string.

Clients assume implementations of ADTs are correct. It is abstracted away.

When writing ADTs, we can change the implementation without worrying about breaking the clients code.

A static array is a weakness in this design pattern, as it has to be resized.

Postconditions are known to be true at the end of the execution of a certain algorithm.
