Generic Max

This file contains two highly versatile methods (both with the same name) that return the largets element in the given Array / Collection. These methods are highly versatile because they are both generic and they take anything that implements the Collection Interface.

Here is a sample output containing the results of the test cases.

Returning the max of [Array of Integers      ]: 80
Returning the max of [Array of Strings       ]: Today
Returning the max of [Array of Booleans      ]: true
Returning the max of [Collection of Integers ]: 80
Returning the max of [Collection of Strings  ]: Today
Returning the max of [Collection of Booleans ]: true
