Sample Questions
================

1. Consider the following code segment.
	for (int k = 0; k < 20; k = k + 2) {
		if (k % 3 == 1) {
			System.out.print(k + " "); 
		}
	}
What is printed as a result of executing the code segment? 
(a) 4 16
(b) 4 10 16				(answer)
(c) 0 6 12 18
(d) 1 4 7 10 13 16 19
(e) 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18


2. Consider the following code segment.
	List<String> animals = new ArrayList<String>();
	animals.add("dog"); 
	animals.add("cat"); 
	animals.add("snake"); 
	animals.set(2, "lizard"); 
	animals.add(1, "fish"); 
	animals.remove(3); 
	System.out.println(animals);

What is printed as a result of executing the code segment?
(a) [dog, fish, cat]			(answer)
(b) [dog, fish, lizard]
(c) [dog, lizard, fish]
(d) [fish, dog, cat]
(e) The code throws an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException exception.

3. Consider the following declarations.
	public interface Shape {
		int isLargerThan(Shape other);
		// Other methods not shown 
	}
	public class Circle implements Shape
	{
		// Other methods not shown
	}

Which of the following method headings of isLargerThan
can be added to the declaration of the Circle class so that it will satisfy the Shape interface?
I. public int isLargerThan(Shape other)
II. public int isLargerThan(Circle other)
III. public boolean isLargerThan(Object other)
(a) I only
(b) II only
(c) III only
(d) I and II only
(e) I, II, and III			(answer)
