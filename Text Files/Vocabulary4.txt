1) An object is created with the new keyword and initialized by a constructor.
2) An object is an instance of a class.
3) An object is an instance of a class.
4) An attribute of an object is the same as an instance variable of an object.
5) An object may declare accessor methods to allow its private attributes to be visible to client classes.
6) An object may declare modifier methods to allow its private attributes to be changed by client classes.
7) If a class does not have a constructor, the compiler will create a no argument constructor and call it upon creation.
8) After a new instance is created with the new keyword, the constructor is called to initialize the newly created object.
9) A constructor normally initializes the attributes of a class.
10) Constructors are different from accessors because one initializes an instance and one makes its private fields visible.
11) A constructor can be viewed as a modifier method because it changes the internal state of a class.
12) A class is a blueprint for the instance of that class.
13) Classes can have attributes too with static variables.
14) A classes accessor methods are often prefixed with get then the property name. ie: getCount()
15) A classes modifier methods are often prefixed with set then the property name. ie: setCount()
16) An attribute of a class can be an instance of another class.
17) To access an instances private variables, a client program can use its accessor methods.
18) To modify an instances private variables, a client program can use its modifier methods.
19) An attribute of an object can be visible through accessor methods.
20)	An attribute of an object can be changed through modifier methods.
21) Accessor and modifier methods can be used to determine or change the state of an object.
