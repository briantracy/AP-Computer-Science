1) A try block is usually, but not always, followed by a catch block.
2) A try catch sequence can be followed by a finally block that will be executed in regardless of wether an exception is thrown.
3) If an error occurs during the execution of a try block, control is transferred to the corresponding catch block.
4) Compile time errors that occur during a try block will not be caught.
5) Run time errors will be caught by a try block.
6) If an exception is thrown in a try block, error correction code will be executed in the associated catch block.
7) A finally block cannot come before a catch block.
8) A catch block must have a specific kind of error it will be catching.
9) A compile time error cannot be caught.
10) A run time error does not have to be fatal if it is caught properly.
11) A catch block is where you put your error correction code.
12) A finally block will execute even if an error did not occur.
13) A finally block all on its own will cause a compile time error.
14) For runtime errors caused while reading from text files, a finally block should always be there to close the resource.
15) A finally block is not the place for error correction code as an error does not have to happen for a finally block to be executed.
16) A compile time error is not an error that can be specified in a catch block.
17) A run time error is a kind of error that the programmer should always be expecting.
18) For every error that might occur, a programmer should write defensive error correction code.
19) Most runtime errors are objects in java that can be caught and thrown while compile time errors are not classes.
20) Error correction code is not effective against compile time errors.
21) Runtime errors can often be dealt with by proper error correction code.
