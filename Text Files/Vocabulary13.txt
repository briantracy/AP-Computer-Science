A binomial coefficient is a number that is a coefficient found in some binomial exponentiation such as (x+y)^5 or (z+r)^9. They are also found as rows in the Pascals Triangle.

A limit is and end behavior of a function as that function approaches some special value like 0 or infinity. Or any arbitrary value.

L’hopitals Rule is something applied to edge-cases in calculus like 0/0 or sin x/x. It helps make sense of these “indeterminate forms”.

Standard Deviation is how “spread out” a set is from its mean. Tightness of a cluster.

1) A union of two sets contains every element found in either set A or set B while an intersection of two sets contains every element found in both set A and set B.
2) A set difference of two sets will contain fewer elements that the union of the two sets.
3) If two sets are not empty, the lower limit of number of elements in a union of the two sets is the number of elements in the larger set.
4) L’hopital’s rule is not needed to be able to graph the union of two sets.
5) A union of two sets will typically have a higher standard deviation that either set.
6) The union of all binomial coefficients can be found in the pascals triangle.
7) An intersection of two sets plus the set difference will yield the union of those two sets.
8) The upper limit of number of elements in an intersection of two sets is the number of elements in the smaller set.
9) L’hopital’s Rule comes in to play when the value of a function intersects with some undefined value such as zero in a denominator.
10) The intersection of two sets 
11) The intersection of any two sets of binomial coefficients will contain the number 1.
12) The upper limit in number of elements in the set difference of two sets is the number of elements in the second set. 
13) The difference of two sets can be determined without taking into consideration l’hopital’s rule.
14) The relative set difference of two sets will usually have a different standard deviation than either original set.
15) The set difference of two sets containing binomial coefficients will never contain 1.
16) L’hopital’s Rule is used to find limits at edge case values of functions.
17) The lower limit of any standard deviation is 0.
18) The lower limit of numbers that are binomial coefficients is 0. 
19) When the standard deviation of the runtime of an algorithm reaches an indeterminate value, L’hopital’s rule must be used.
20) Binomial Coefficients are not used in tandem with l’hopital’s rule.
21) The standard deviation of rows in the pascals triangle made from binomial coefficients increases as the row number increases.
