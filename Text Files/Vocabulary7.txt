1) An object method is invoked on an instance while a class method is invoked on a class.
2) The this keyword refers to the instance that an object method was called on while inside that method.
3) While in the scope of object methods, variables are implicitly treated as instance variables. There is no need for this.
4) While in the scope of an object method, if there is local variable with the same name as a field, you must explicitly state which one you want to modify.
5) One object method of a graph object would be to draw all of the graph's edges.
6) Another object method of a graph would be to draw all of the graph's nodes.
7) Within a class method, the this keyword is not available as it cannot be referenced from a static context.
8) Within a class, class methods can be called implicitly without the name of the class.
9) Outside of a that class, class methods must explicitly be called as a function of that class.
10) A class method of an edge object could be to create an instance with specific properties.
11) A class method of a node object could be to create a node with a default position such as the origin.
12) The this keyword is implicitly passed to each object method.
13) The this keyword must explicitly be used of there is a name conflict in an object method.
14) In an edge class, the this keyword would refer to the current instance of an edge object.
15) In a node class, the this keyword would refer to the current instance of a node object.
16) Casts between variable types can either be implicit or explicit.
17) In an edge class, the implicit this variable will be of type edge.
18) In a node class, the implicit this variable will be of type node.
19) If an edge variable wanted to be changed to a vertex variable, an explicit cast is needed.
20) If a node class contains an int instance variable, it does not have to be explicitly cast to a java.lang.Integer, this is done automatically through auto boxing.
21) The connection between two nodes on a graph is an edge.
