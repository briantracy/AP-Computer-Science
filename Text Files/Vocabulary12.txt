1) One Map in Java is implemented with a Hash Table to store entries.
2) A Map and Queue are both abstract data types.
3) Maps can be stored on the heap and referenced. 
4) In Java, you can store a linked list in a map as both a key and a value.
5) Maps often perform in O log n time or better for most operations.
6) A Map does not have an associated tree depth.
7) A queue is ordered but a Hash Table is not.
8) A heap can be implemented as a hash table.
9) Hash Table and Linked List are both in the Collections API in java.
10) Most common hash table operations can be implemented in O log n time.
11) Unlike trees, hash tables do not have depth.
12) A heap has no linear order but a linked list does.
13) A queue can be implemented as a linked list with restrictions on how elements are accessed.
14) Adding to a queue is not a O log n operation, it is an O 1 operation.
15) Elements in a queue can be labeled by their index while elements in a tree can be labeled by their depth.
16) A linked list does not satisfy the “heap property”.
17) Deleting the minimum element in a binary heap is an O log n operation.
18) Heaps that are implemented as trees have nodes with associated depth.
19) Insertion to a linked list is constant, not O log n time.
20) Tree depth in a linked list could be a nodes distance from the root of the list.
21) The tree depth of a n vertex tree is log n.
